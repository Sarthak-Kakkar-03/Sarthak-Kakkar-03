👋 Greetings! I'm Sarthak Kakkar, a second-year Computer Science major at Northeastern University with a deep-rooted passion for Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

🔍 Exploring My Path:
While I'm still pinpointing the exact trajectory of my career, I've gained valuable experience in Java programming and am actively engaged in Machine Learning. I'm thrilled to have recently published research at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) and am preparing for my next research project.

🌐 Broadening Horizons:
I'm also expanding my skill set through online courses focused on web development, and I'm in the process of creating a portfolio website to showcase my work.

🎥 Beyond Coding:
I have a flair for video editing and am proficient in software like DaVinci Resolve Studio and Filmora.

🎤 Leadership & Teamwork:
In high school, I honed my leadership skills by hosting events and successfully leading teams of over 60 people. This experience has equipped me with the ability to manage large groups and coordinate complex tasks effectively.
